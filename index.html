        <img src="monkey-orchid.JPG" width="750px" alt="The Monkey Orchid is about the size of an adult hand, with a central, velvety part that feels like a small, cushioned pad. On either side of this central part are softer, fringed petals, similar to the tactile sensation of delicate fabric or feathers. The flower emits a subtle, fruity aroma. This unique assembly gives the plant an animate quality, much like how a monkey's face would have various distinct textures from its nose to its fur. Native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and Peru, it goes by the scholarly name of Dracula simia." title="Dracula Simia, also known as Monkey Orchid">
